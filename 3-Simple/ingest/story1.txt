Sarah is planning a road trip from City A to City B, which is 240 miles away. She expects to drive at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. Sarah plans to make a rest stop halfway through the journey, which is 120 miles from the starting point. If she drives for 2 hours and then stops for a 30-minute break, what time will she arrive at City B if she starts her trip at 8:00 AM?
